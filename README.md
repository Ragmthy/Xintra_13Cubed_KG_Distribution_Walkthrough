# Xintra_13Cubed_KG_Distribution_Walkthrough
A walkthrough on solving the KG Distribution Mini Lab By Xintra and 13Cubed

# XINTRA LABS (Abu Jibal OC)
Creating a Repository of Walkthrough for KG Distribution Mini Lab created by [XINTRA](https://www.xintra.org/). 

A fifth XINTRA (mini) lab attempted, the goal of this repository is to document my notes and thought processes for each section like I've done so for my previous ones. 
This is a scenario whereby one can solve the entire lab with the results from one tool, MemProcFS. The goal of MemProcFS is to allow one to conduct Memory Forensics on an endpoint and a server. 
Full innovation credits for this lab goes to [XINTRA's team](https://www.xintra.org/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20our%0AExperienced%20Trainers) and [13Cubed](https://training.13cubed.com/about-us).
More information about the labs can be found [here](https://www.xintra.org/labs).

## Repo:
This time around, I've uploaded the walkthrough as one [singular scroll](https://github.com/Ragmthy/Xintra_13Cubed_KG_Distribution_Walkthrough/blob/main/KG%20Distribution%20Mini%20Lab.md) 📜 It can be read entirely here.
